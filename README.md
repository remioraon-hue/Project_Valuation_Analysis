# Project_Valuation_Analysis
This project explores “unicorn” startups—private companies valued over $1B—by applying machine learning to predict company valuations. Using financial metrics, EDA, feature engineering, and regression models, it supports valuation analysis, trend insights, and data-driven investment or hiring decisions.
